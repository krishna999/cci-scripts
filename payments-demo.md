Caller: What is an EFS money code?

(Agent Assistant pops up)

Agent: An EFS money code is a series of numbers that is issued by a company to represent a payment. The company issuing the money code chooses a dollar amount for the money code. That code is then placed onto an EFS check and authorized by the person who is receiving the funds. That authorization code validates the legitimacy of the check.

Caller: How can I activate EFS card?

(Agent Assistant pops up)

Agent:  You can follow these steps to activate your EFS card: To set up a new EFS card, click “Select Program,” then “Manage Cards” Then choose “Update Cards” from the drop-down menu in the upper right corner of the screen From here, you’ll want to look up the card you want to assign by entering the last four digits of the card number or by entering the unit number or policy number Then click “Look Up Cards” Once the card information displays in the search results area, click on the card number you want to assign This takes you to the car detail screen where you will access and set up all of the information for that card First, select the appropriate policy number to which the card will be assigned The policy is important because it dictates how the group of cards will behave. For example, the policy defines the card product limit, where the card can be used, and what prompts are required on that card Under card status, select “Active” You will then want to determine if that card can be entered at the point-of-sale or if you require the car to be physically swiped. Typically, you would leave this set to “Policy” which would automatically refer to the policy for how to handle this type of transaction. Under the information section, you'll want to select “Both”which tells the system to use the information associated with both the card and the policy in terms of how the card behaves Finally, click "Save" Sources: Watch this video -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgcMy0dThNg&t=2s, https://www.wexinc.com/insights/blog/inside-wex/fleet-faqs-for-all-your-fleet-management-questions/
